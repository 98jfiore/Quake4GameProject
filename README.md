## Dating Sim <br />
In order to open and play the dating sim mod, open the dating_sim branch, build IDLib and then Game, take the output gamex86.dll file and put it in a mod folder in Quake 4.
In that Mod folder under Quake 4, copy and paste the folders in the /pakFiles folder directly into there.
Finally, open up the Mod, and start playing. <br />
  ### What it does: <br />
    Enemies do not attack nor do allies
    All doors are open so no area is off limits
