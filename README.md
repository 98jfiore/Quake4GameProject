  ### What it does: <br />
    Enemies do not attack nor do allies
    All doors are open so no area is off limits
    "Talking" to an enemy starts a date
    In the date, use your movement keys to select dialog options and click to advance dialog
    Your date will either end in immediate failure or a minigame.
    You control each minigame by either clicking or using your movement keys.

    Rockets fire at an increased Rate
    Rockets do not consume ammo
