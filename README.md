## Dating Sim <br />
In order to open and play the dating sim mod, open the dating_sim branch, build IDLib and then Game, take the output gamex86.dll file and put it in a mod folder in Quake 4.
In that Mod folder under Quake 4, copy and paste the folders in the /pakFiles folder directly into there.
Finally, open up the Mod, and start playing. <br />
  ### What it does: <br />
    Enemies do not attack nor do allies
    All doors are open so no area is off limits
    "Talking" to an enemy starts a date
    In the date, use your movement keys to select dialog options and click to advance dialog
    Your date will either end in immediate failure or a minigame.
    You control each minigame by either clicking or using your movement keys.
  ### Deliverables it accomplishes: <br />
    Removes combat from the game <br />
    You can roam around and ask Stroggs on dates <br />
    When you ask a Strogg on a date, it cuts to a dating scene <br />
    A dialog tree is used during the dates with multiple possible outcomes <br />
    Dates can end in one of four minigames <br />
